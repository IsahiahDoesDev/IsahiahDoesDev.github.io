# 🏛️ The Showroom: IsaiahDoesDev Portfolio

 **"From Warehouse to Systems Engineer. The Magnum Opus."**

Welcome to the source code of my personal portfolio and central hub. This is **Project #00** of the 100 Projects Challenge.

This application is more than a resume; it is a **Showroom** designed to display the "Flagship" applications and the "Bricks" built during my journey to master full-stack systems engineering.

## 💎 The Vision

I am transitioning from a background in warehouse logistics to software engineering. My goal is not just to "learn to code," but to build a body of work that proves engineering rigor.

**The Showroom** serves three purposes:
1.  **The Collection:** A curated display of my "Flagship" SaaS applications (e.g., InventoryOS, TicketSync).
2.  **The Bricks:** A carousel showcasing the foundational "Toy" apps built for skill acquisition.
3.  **The AI Assistant:** A custom RAG-powered chatbot ("Portfolio AI") that answers questions about my resume and tech stack.
